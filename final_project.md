# Final Project Part I

## Introduction & Outline

### Story Title
Where does our "unboxing experience" end up?

### Topic Choice
A lot of people enjoy the unboxing experience after purchases of new items. I'm also one of them. However, as I accidentally stumbled upon the amount of waste generated in order to provide our unboxing experience. In fact, container and packaging waste account for 29.9% of total solid wasted generated in the United States. At 80,080 thousand metric tons, that's a lot of waste, so I'm curious about how these waste are disposed and what are the potential harms. Finally, what're some of the implications from how container and packaging waste are disposed.

### Story Arc

### Delivery Format
The data story will be presented using Shorthand.

## Data Source
The main source of data comes from US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), which provides data on total volume of container and packaging waste.
The data can be found on [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/containers-and-packaging-product-specific-data). A copy is also provided [`final project.pdf`](final_project_data.pdf).
