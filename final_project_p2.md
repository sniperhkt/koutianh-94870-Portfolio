# Final Project Part II

## Introduction

Part II of this project mainly follows the design of Part I, but here're some changes:
* The final delivery platform will be infogram instead of shorthand. I find infogram creates everything I needed to make the final deliverable all in one place, whereas shorthand requires imports from multiple places.
* Some design changes that will be addressed in the following section.

## Design Changes

* The treemap has been removed from the storyline as it does not tell important information that helps to develope the story.
* Due to technical difficulty, the first sketch can't relized. Instead, a separate itemized list is created to show example of each waste category.
* As a feedback from viewer of the sketch, the color scheme was confusion, so I changed the color scheme of the final version to be consistent and intuitive.
* Also according to feedback, the potential harm of waste disposal need more visual highlight in order for readers to keep focused.

## Final Data Story

### Intended Audience

The intended audience should be regular consumers who throw away packagings of their purchase, which later become a huge source of waste. Since companies should already notice that packaging waste problem with vanguard companies already taking actions to address this issue, it is impractical to advertise to companies about this problem. However, regular comsumers may not be aware the huge amount of waste they throw away, so it is worthwhile to inform them of how much waste they created simply by throwing away the packagings. I also added a final paragraph informing what comsumers could do in response to container and packaging waste.

### Summary of Work

This project begins with finding an interesting topic. I was going to do a project related to automotive industry, but then I fell short of finding appropriate data set to begin with. After more digging, I realized that finding usable dataset is harder than finding an interesting topic. Then, I switched my strategy. Instead, I looked at interesting dataset and then thought about what good story I can tell. After more searching, I ended up using this container and packaging waste data for my final project.

I then followed the common steps of constructing storyline, making sketches and asking for feedback to improve. Then, I redid the charts in sketches to make them more consistend in color use and more visually pleasing. I also write out the full storyline to fit the charts.
